# Milk Volume and Price Prediction in Ireland using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models to predict both milk volumes and prices produced at a national level in Ireland. The goal is to provide accurate weekly forecasts over horizons ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, to help stakeholders in the dairy industry make informed decisions and optimize their management.


# Data

The data used in this project is sourced from various origins:

Historical milk production data: Weekly milk volumes produced in Ireland.
Meteorological information: Temperatures, precipitation, etc.
Economic data: Milk prices, production costs, etc.
Agricultural practice statistics: Herd sizes, cow feeding practices, etc.

# Methods

Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and formatting data to make it usable for ML algorithms.
Feature selection: Identifying the most relevant variables for predicting milk volumes and prices.
Model training and evaluation: Utilizing various ML algorithms (linear regression, random forests, neural networks, etc.) to build predictive models and assess their performance on test data.

# Results

The project results will be presented in the form of tables and graphs, illustrating the performance of different ML models for various forecast horizons. The most effective models will be selected, and their predictions will be analyzed in detail.
